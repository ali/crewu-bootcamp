					<p><h1>1. FileSystems</h1>
<h3>1.1 Introduction to filesystems, a few facts:</h3>
<ul>
<li>There are 2 things, Files and Folders.</li>
<li>These are arranged in a &quot;tree&quot; structure with folders containing more files &amp;
folders</li>
<li>The root folder is located at &quot;/&quot;.</li>
<li>A file path is the list of folders needed to arrive at a particular point in
the tree: &quot;/home/fakeuser/documents/classes/&quot;</li>
<li>Your home directory is located at &quot;/home/user&quot;. A shortcut for this is to use
&quot;~&quot;.</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.2 A couple more things:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Adding a drive (USB, or other) to a filesystem is called &quot;mounting&quot; this just
means that you add the drive as another branch on your tree at some point in
the tree.</li>
<li>Full paths are paths that start at the &quot;root&quot; of the filesystem (&quot;/&quot;) and then
go from there (you can use &quot;~&quot; to abbreviate if you would like.</li>
<li>Relative file paths are ones that start at the directory you are in and go on
from there.</li>
<li>Unix filesystems have 2 folders inside every folder &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot; these are
&quot;this folder&quot; and &quot;the folder above&quot; respectively. these are very helpful when
needing to refer to folders or files that are near your current location in the
filesystem.</li>
<li>Unix filesystems hide files and folders from &quot;normal&quot; view by putting a &quot;.&quot; at
the beginning of the name like this: &quot;.config&quot;</li>
</ul>
<h3>1.3 Other good to know things:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Flags! <br>
Commands have flags, such as &quot;-a&quot; or &quot;-r&quot; these can be combined &quot;-avz&quot; or used
separately &quot;-avz -e&quot; these flags alter the way that commands you enter into your
terminal operate.</li>
<li>Shells:
There are several different shells that provide additional functionality to your
linux experience such as &quot;tab completion&quot; of commands and prompts, we will go
into greater detail about shells later.</li>
</ul>
